    <h1>Morgan McPeak</h1>
    <p>My name is Morgan McPeak. I am a graphic designer, illustrator, copywriter, small business owner,
        home owner and drummer. I also have a lot of hobbies. I like to stay as busy as possible at all 
        times, which sometimes reveals my flaws, such as not reading deadline dates correctly. Although 
        I tend to get myself into situations where I'm in a bit of a time crunch, these are the moments 
        where I find myself to be the most productive and able to learn new skills. I've
        included some images of inspirational posters, which were a recent freelance project
        of mine.
